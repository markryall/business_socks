This is a little shoes application to help you stick to an agenda.

How do you use it?

* install ruby (http://ruby-lang.org)
* install shoes (http://shoooes.net)
* git clone git://github.com/markryall/business_socks.git
* cd business_socks/lib
* shoes business_socks.rb
* type 'l' (ie. load)
* browse to one of the agenda files at the root of the project

Voila!

A single bicycle bell sounds at the 1/3 and 2/3 point and then a double bicycle bell marks the end of an event.

Other commands:

's' - start timer
'S' - stop timer or agenda
'l' - load an agenda
'+' - add one minute to the current event (while running an agenda)
'-' - subtract one minute to the current event (while running an agenda)
'k' - kill the current event (while running an agenda - note that this doesn't quite work properly)
'K' - kill all events (while running an agenda)
